<p> I have spent the last few years of my life working as an independent contractor for brand ambassador needs
    for many different companies and also do event staffing, promo and bartending on the side.
    <br>
    <br>Originally, I wanted to be a nurse and took up two years of community college between SCC and PVCC doing
    general coursework and light beginning nurse classes before I realized it wasnt what I loved to do. I am
    now ready to embark on my career as a software engineer, as I have finally found something that I love. 
    <br>
    <br> I am currently a student through the University of Arizona at the coding bootcamp. Upon graduation in 
    October of 2018, I plan to finish my associates degree in computer science since my general coursework is already
    completed.
